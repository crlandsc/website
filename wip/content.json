  "about": [
    "I love everything involving music, technology, and sound. I work as a machine learning engineer researching and developing new audio technologies with a focus on deep learning and spatial audio. I have also consulted on the acoustical design of the built environment, with projects ranging from performance venues to recording studios. My work and research include developing and implementing algorithms to perform audio source separation, music sample generation, sound source detection, and binaural audio externalization. I have also developed other software to measure acoustics metrics, model wave behavior, process spatial audio, and create audio effects plugins.",
    "When I am not focused on the design of sound and technology through my work or research, I am writing, recording, or performing music. I play guitar (electric, acoustic, bass), percussion, piano, and even dabble with the banjo. My artist name is After August (check me out on Spotify), and I play musical styles from jazz to rock to folk and everything in between. I love all types of music.",
    "I live in Chicago with my wife, Steph, and our little dog, Queso. Steph works as an IR Nurse at Northwestern Memorial Hospital assisting with groundbreaking operations daily and Queso takes naps on my lap daily as I work at my desk. I play in the local kickball league and love to escape to the Adirondack Mountains in NY each summer for some hiking, kayaking, and time with the family."
