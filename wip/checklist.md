To Do:
- Fix video backgrounds for mobile
    - Likely will have to go back into blender (or canva) and save out other versions of these videos.
    - Is there a better format to save these as? What is the smallest file size I can make them?
    - Works fine for desktop, but appears goofy for mobile. Just make the background match whatever color it is overtop of (responsive to light/dark mode)?
- Website seems to require a lot of resources on mobile, but runs easily on desktop. Why is this?

- Fix "interests" carousel
    - Further curate images (decent for now, but could be better)
    - Auto-scroll works, but there is no interactivity. Add arrows or ability to swipe? How to integrate this without creating bugs/conflicts
- Change header "Music", "Portfolio", and "Resume" to highlight separate color (yellow/gold?)
- Add project icons
- after-august.com site - Change reference to go to After August site.
