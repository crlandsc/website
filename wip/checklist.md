To Do:
- Fix "interests" carousel - better images and better looking boxes/cards
    - Auto-scroll sort of works. But it takes time to start for some reason and then has trouble once it gets to the end of the images.
- Fix Education & Research in small screen mode - position is wrong and horizontal lines don't work
- Change header "Music", "Portfolio", and "Resume" to highlight separate color (yellow/gold?)
- Add project icons
- Standardize animation (footer different from Academic Publications)
- Make sure "Let's Connect" box work correctly - just send to mail app?
- Change hero image - needs to better adapt with light/dark mode
- Fix GitHub actions

Completed:
- Re-align skills bullets (seemsto be slightly off the cetnering of the titles)
- Make footer icons a little closer together to make sure they stay on one line in mobile format
- Replaced text links with icon links for Google Scholar and ResearchGate
- Added larger icons with labels in the Academic Publications section
- Added hover effects with accent color highlighting for publication icons
- Made project cards fully clickable with JavaScript
- Added visual cues (border highlight and shadow) to project cards on hover
- Add binaural externalization GIF
