To Do:
- Change hero image - needs to better adapt with light/dark mode
- Change header "Music", "Portfolio", and "Resume" to highlight separate color (yellow/gold?)
- Re-align skills bullets (seemsto be slightly off the cetnering of the titles)
- Fix Education & Research in small screen mode - position is wrong and horizontal lines don't work
- Make footer icons a little closer together to make sure they stay on one line in mobile format
- Add project icons
- Add binaural externalization GIF
- Fix "interests" carousel
- Make sure "Let's Connect" box work correctly
- Standardize animation (footer different from Academic Publications)

Completed:
- Replaced text links with icon links for Google Scholar and ResearchGate
- Added larger icons with labels in the Academic Publications section
- Added hover effects with accent color highlighting for publication icons
- Made project cards fully clickable with JavaScript
- Added visual cues (border highlight and shadow) to project cards on hover
