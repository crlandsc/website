To Do:
- Fix "interests" carousel - better images and better looking boxes/cards
    - Auto-scroll sort of works. But it takes time to start for some reason and then has trouble once it gets to the end of the images.
- Change header "Music", "Portfolio", and "Resume" to highlight separate color (yellow/gold?)
- Add project icons
- Fix GitHub actions

Completed:
- Standardize animations
    - Fixed persistent lag in zoom animation for cards - now they have the same smooth/instant zoom as the icons
    - Fixed underline animation to be consistent between binaural externalization card and project cards
    - Text highlights blue on all card to help signify this is a link
- Fix Education & Research in small screen mode - position is wrong and horizontal lines don't work
- Make sure "Let's Connect" box work correctly - only client-side solution is to use mailto protocol.
- Change hero image - animation that works with light/dark mode
    - Add shadow to hero text
    - Make code waveform text slightly more apparent color-wise (i.e. dark for light mode and vice versa)
    - Re-implement paralax effect
- Re-align skills bullets (seemsto be slightly off the cetnering of the titles)
- Make footer icons a little closer together to make sure they stay on one line in mobile format
- Replaced text links with icon links for Google Scholar and ResearchGate
- Added larger icons with labels in the Academic Publications section
- Added hover effects with accent color highlighting for publication icons
- Made project cards fully clickable with JavaScript
- Added visual cues (border highlight and shadow) to project cards on hover
- Add binaural externalization GIF
