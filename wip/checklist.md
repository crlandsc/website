To Do:
- Update profile image
- Update carousel images
- Update bio (include Myles!)
- Fix video backgrounds for mobile
    - Likely will have to go back into blender (or canva) and save out other versions of these videos.
    - Is there a better format to save these as? What is the smallest file size I can make them?
    - Works fine for desktop, but appears goofy for mobile. Just make the background match whatever color it is overtop of (responsive to light/dark mode)?
